## Why i create this script?
I created this script because we would need to migrate all our wordpress, joomla, drupal site to a secure control panel.
And we discover this control panel called cyberpanel and use this as alternative. But the control panel Web Ui is very slow and decided to create a script a Friendly Ui for CLI Users. There is already a CLI command called "cyberpanel", but you need to memorize some sort of parameters to use the command-line.
